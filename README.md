Work in progress of a hire site, potentially portfolio site!
Lots to do:
1. Add React
2. Refactor
3. Add Typescript
4. Put some routes in for an about me page. Should I make projects their own page?
5. Add some animation, at least something like scrollmagic.
6. Finalize consistent spacing.
7. Decide if this will be a SPA hireme or portfolio. 
8. Fix file system
9. Host on AWS or Heroku
